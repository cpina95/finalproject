  <h1>Cuba:</h1>
    <h2>A Glimpse at the Past, and a Look at the Present.</h2>
      <p>A Website by Christy Piña</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
            <p>In 1492, the Spanish colonized Cuba, but before they landed on Cuban territory, the island was inhabited by three different indigenous tribes: the Taíno, the Guanajatabey, and the Ciboney people. When the Spanish colonized Cuba, they ruled the island until 1898, when the Spanish ceded Perto Rico, the Philippines and Guam to the United States. A few years later, Cuba gained its independence from the United States, though the U.S. still had the right to intervene in Cuban affairs, supervise its finances and foreign relations.</p>
            <p>In 1959, the Communist Party took over Cuba, after sending former president, Fulgencio Batista, into exile. Today, the Communist Party is still in charge. Though the U.S. saw the revolution as a positive thing at first, Fidel Castro's installation of the Communist Party caused a strain in the two countries' relations. As tensions escalated, the U.S. tried to overthrow the Communist government with an attack called the Bay of Pigs and failed. Cuba partnered up with Russia, the USSR at the time, which eventually led tot he Cuban Missile Crisis. Last year, Fidel Castro passed away, but his brother Raul, is still in power.</p>

        <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Cuban culture is a result of its amalgamation of cultures, mainly African and Spanish. The Cuban culture consists of music, food, dance and sports. Son, danzón, mambo, cha-cha-cha and salsa music make up the music part of Cuban culture. Cuban cuisine (in my opinon is one of the greatest things in the world) is made up primarily  of rice, beans, plantains, shredded beef, pork, cuban bread and tropical fruits. Because music is such a big part of the culture (or "la cultura" as Cubans called it), dancing is just as big. Being able to dance to the rhythm of the music is something in Hispanic culture, but Cuban especially, that is almost natural. A lot of the sports that are popular in Cuba are popular in the U.S. The biggest sport in Cuba is baseball. </p>
